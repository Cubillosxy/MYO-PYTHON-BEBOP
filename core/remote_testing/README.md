Remote Testing
==================

Here you can find small code snippets for testing of requested features, 
which I cannot check at the moment. Note, that because this code is not
tested it is even more risky/dangerous than the rest of this project.

On the other hand you are more then welcome if you understand the risks
(and the code) and you would like to test it and send me corresponding
log files with results :-)
