Katarina Behaviors
==================

In this directory you should find small programs ("behaviors") which could be
integrated in more complex scenarios. The motivation for the folder name is
from
[Behavior-based Robotics](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior-based_robotics)
and
[Three-layer Architecture](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-layer_architecture)

Available behaviors:

* navbox.py --- navigate drone to land on the box with Parrot ARDrone2 marker
