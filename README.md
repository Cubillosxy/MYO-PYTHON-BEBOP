# Notes

This  project is *work in progress* and it is your responsibility if you decide to use it without understanding the risks.
Inspiration and message codes are taken from official Parrot SDK:
https://github.com/ARDroneSDK3

Requirements:
* Python 2.X 
* Myo library
* Myo Connect

that project uses:
https://github.com/robotika/katarina/   library for control of bebop
https://github.com/NiklasRosenstein/myo-python	 library for control of Myo

Actually only you can fly, the video stream is not supported.
Warning! this project uses libraries who still is on developing , then you can experimenter different problems
I recommend restart the program for any problem, if the issue continue reconnect all the devices.

The code evolved into next files:

* main.py      ---this is the main file who import other control files, this file contains the GUI, 
* Drone_Int.py --- here you can find some functions for fly drone.
* myo_Input.py --- this file contains the main functions for send and receiver data for myo, also contain functions for data procesing 

Known bugs:
* Wifi drone only support one connection, for avoid problems only connect your PC to Wifi drone
